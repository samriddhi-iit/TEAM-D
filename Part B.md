Part - B
Improvements in the website that are needed are:
1. Resource Accessibility: The current website doesn’t showcase the vast content that Communique provides.
2. User Interface (UI) and Experience (UX): The current website layout feels somewhat dated and serves more as a brochure than a tool.
3. Feature Enhancements: Making a separate forum where students can ask soft-skill-related questions that are answered by the society's “Governors."

 
Problems and limitations in the website:
1. The picture used in the hero section is of low resolution and doesn’t reflect IIT KGP. It looks very pixelated as the quality of the picture used isn’t high.
2. The governor’s section format isn’t equal; the blue boxes are of different heights.
3. The footer doesn’t tell the location or really any important information about our society.
4. Formatting of the website is dated and very word-heavy.
   
Improvements made in the website:
1. The hero section’s image is made clearer and related to IIT KGP.
2. There is a contact forum given on the website.
3. The information about the governors is given in a more sleek fashion and looks less disordered.
4. The footer now has more information than on the official website.
5. More eye-catching symbols are used instead of just text.
