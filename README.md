# TEAM-D
The three advanced features that were used are:
1) Complex multi-breakpoint grid layout: "core competencies" were stated using a grid format.
2) Strong accessibility features such as skip links, focus outlines, and proper alt text: skip links can be accessed by pressing the tab key.
3) Staggered animations or smooth transitions using keyframes: wave motion in the hero section was made by keyframes.
